# Holoo Compiler

## Description

This project develops a compiler for the "Holoo" programming language, transforming Holoo code into individual tokens and finally the syntax tree. 

The compiler consists of two phases: lexical analysis, which breaks down source code into tokens; syntactic analysis (parsing), which checks the code's grammatical structure; and code generation, which produces equivalent assembly instructions. 

Emphasis is placed on creating a robust lexical analyzer that prevents unexpected terminations and ensures reliable tokenization. 
  
This Programming Language is inspired by C/C++ and Java.
